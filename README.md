Free & Open Source Lethal Company Trainer, using Read/Write memory methods to avoid FPS drops.


## What i Used

[Swed64](https://github.com/Massivetwat/Swed64) Library to write/read game memory 

[Cheat Engine 7.5](https://www.cheatengine.org/) To dump the game offsets


## Is it safe to use?

 Yes, atleast for now, Lethal Company doesn't have Anti-Cheat, you can even use Cheat Engine without any restrictions!
